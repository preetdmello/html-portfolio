<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!!
My Name is Preet Dmello, I am a student of Angela Yu. I have just began learning web development. Well,I haven't added much stuff but 
as the page says it should be about me,I'll just go about it.
</p>

<p>Well , I am an engineering aspirant and studying engineering has taken a great toll on my mind .You have to learn a lot of things just
to be in pace with your fellowmates. There are peers who you think are nerds but in reality these nerds have a lot of tech-knowledge.
I didn't wanted to be left behind , thus just for keeping my standard high , I took this course . But as you can see I am seriously taking
interest in these things and am actually trying to build a webpage overhere. I hope you'll find it interesting and help me be motivated 
throughout the course.
</p>

<p>The summary of my website is as follows : Birthday Invite-Contact Me-Movie Ranking. Anyways I don't want to bore you up with all these paragraphs.
Just enjoy throught the webpage and give me a proper feedback by contacting me through the number given.
